# Why This is Here?

"OMG!  Did you just put moderator documents online for everyone to see?!"

Oh yes we did.

I personally believe the more visible our actions are, the more accountable and consistant we are with any actions we take as moderators.  This site is built with the idea to help Rapture moderators enfource our rules and policies but, honestly, can be modified to be used by any server.

Processes outlined here are more about sharing the overall intent.  While they are written to be followed step-by-step, moderators should feel free to diverge from them should they feel it necessary.

"Doesn't that go against the whole 'being consistant' thing?"

Yes and no.  While moderation tasks have repeated tasks, there should be enough flexibility to allow for discretion.  For example, if a member has turned particularly toxic, it may be appropriate to skip the whole "warning" phase and just server mute them.

The goal of these documents is to model the heart and soul of each policy and rule so that appropriate measures can be followed.
