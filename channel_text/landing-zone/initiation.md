# Initiation

**__Initiation__**

You will see a few more channels now.  <#752095507618463765> is now available if you have any questions regarding the rules or the server.  Keep in mind that slowmode is activated so you can only send a message every 5 seconds, longer if the server is being raided.

Before you gain access to the rest of the server, you must create an introduction and fill out your <#752159904722190387>.  This helps everyone get to know you a bit.  For your introduction, please use this format:

-- message break --

```
**Name:** Discord Username (or IRL name/nickname/etc if you prefer)
**Age:** 84 (feel free to use 20+, "late 30s", etc. but try to be reasonable)
**Gender:** Male (How YOU identify)
**Location:** Eastern Time (GMT-5) (Timezone, region, geographic area.  Try to be specific, without being broad.  For example "California" is okay while "Northern Hemisphere" is not.)
**Orientation:** Straight (Who are you attracted to?)
**Role:** Dom, Sub, Switch, etc.  (What is your BDSM role?  if you don't know, say "Exploring")
**Relationship Status:** Open/Poly (Self-explanitory but you may say "Rather not say")
**DM Status:** Open/Closed/Ask (or some combination)
**Kinks:** MUST LIST AT LEAST 3!!  Even if you're exploring, type something you think you're interested in.
**Limits:** MUST LIST AT LEAST 3!!  Even if you're exploring, type something you think you don't want.
**About:** Think of this as your Tinder profile.  Put some effort here.  Tell us what you do in your spare time, hobbies, likes and dislikes.  Be concise but with enough detail for us to get to know you.  Go through existing intros to see what's already been accepted.  This section should be at least three complete sentences.

```

-- message break --

Introductions must be posted within 48 hours of your arrival.  If you haven't done that, we'll politely give you a server kick.  You're welcome back any time but we try to keep people active and moving in the server.

All of the above are required fields.  Once you've posted your introduction in <#752098112461471844>, wait a moderator to approve it.  Depending on Timezones, etc, it might take some time.  While you're waiting, please feel free to hang out with folks in <#752095507618463765>.

Remember: you are encouraged to edit your introduction as many times as you'd like but must follow the guidelines listed above.  If you create more than one post, the mods have discretion to delete your oldest post.

Once you are approved, you will be an **Initiate** for about two weeks.  During this time, get to know the server and it's members.  Mods are generally more lenient on initiates but do not abuse or take advantage of this.  Please explore, chat, and familiarize yourself with what we're about.  We hope you enjoy it here.
