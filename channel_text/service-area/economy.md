# Economy

<@763577946211745814> is a self-hosted version of the NadekoBot (<https://gitlab.com/Kwoth/nadekobot>).  Full commands can be found on their website (<https://nadeko.bot/commands>) but keep in mind that the server only has the following modules enabled:

- **gambling**
-- "WaifuClaimCommands" disabled
-- "FlowerShopCommands" disabled
-- all other gambling games can be played in <#758133041213210635>
- **games**
-- only the `.pick` and `.plant` commands are available in the chat channels
-- all other games can be played in <#758133041213210635>

The currency of the server is called "Banana Peels".  Peels are earned in one of three ways:
- :banana: 5 by typing `.timely` in <#758133041213210635> every 2 hours
- various amounts for participating in server events such as picture themes, etc.
- :banana: 2 randomly (2% chance) while chatting in the following enabled channels:

All members, including mods and admins, may purchase items listed in the Store below.  And although admins are in the unique position to give away currency, they won't because it will **RUIN THE ECONOMY**.  :rofl:

All items are sold by "the server" and banana peels return to the pool for further distribution.  At this time, you may not buy things from other users.  If there is interest in this, I'll consider it.  

Please note that this is very experimental.  I'll try to keep settings relatively stable but data loss (and thus accumulated peels) is possible.  Don't go *too* wild claiming peels.
