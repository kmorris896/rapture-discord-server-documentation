# Economy

<@763577946211745814> (Name may change) is a self-hosted version of the NadekoBot (<https://gitlab.com/Kwoth/nadekobot>).  Full commands can be found on their website (<https://nadeko.bot/commands>) but keep in mind that the server only has the following modules enabled:

- **gambling**
-- "WaifuClaimCommands" disabled
-- "FlowerShopCommands" disabled
-- all other gambling games can be played in <#758133041213210635>
- **games**
-- only the `.pick` command are available in the chat channels
-- all other games can be played in <#758133041213210635>

Please note that this is very experimental.  I'll try to keep settings relatively stable but data loss (and thus accumulated peels) is possible.  Don't go *too* wild claiming peels.
