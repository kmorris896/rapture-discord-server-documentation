# Bots Info

Like many servers, we utilize various bots to assist in the administration of various tasks as well as provide services to our members.  In order to be transparent about all the bots on our servers, this channel is used to provide context and details on each one and how they are deployed through the server.

All bots have the <@&752094094372634634> role and have full access to the "Server Admin" category of the server.

<@235148962103951360> is a general server administration bot that provides reaction-based roles as well as general moderation tools such as mass purging of messages, ban/mute commands, as well as provides a log of message edits/deletes.

Due to the nature of the bot, it has administrative rights to the server and can see all channels.

<@234395307759108106> is a bot that plays music in VC channels. It only has access to <#763178904595988520> and VC Channels <#763178861491519498> and <#756989066398007347>. Access to other channels is being evaluated. If this would be of value to you, please be sure to suggest it in <#754995041117798480>.

The bot has been server-deafened, meaning that it cannot hear anything in VC channels.

<@763577946211745814> (Name may change) is a self-hosted version of the NadekoBot (<https://gitlab.com/Kwoth/nadekobot>).  While this bot has the ability to read messages made on the server, it is mostly restricted to channels under the "Chat" channel category as well as <#758133041213210635>.  This is Rapture's official economy bot.  For details on how the economy works, please see <#763754268482076672>.

Please note: This bot is currently experimental on the server.  Economy may shift widely as settings are changed.  Your accumulated peels may change, be removed, etc. without notice.  While the goal is to make this stable, if you lose your peels between server updates...oh well.  :wink:
