# Bots Info

Like many servers, we utilize various bots to assist in the administration of various tasks as well as provide services to our members.  In order to be transparant about all the bots on our servers, this channel is used to provide context and details on each one and how they are deployed through the server.

All bots have the <@&752094094372634634> role and have full access to the "Server Admin" category of the server.
