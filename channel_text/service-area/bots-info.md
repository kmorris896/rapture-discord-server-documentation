# Bots Info

Like many servers, we utilize various bots to assist in the administration of various tasks as well as provide services to our members.  In order to be transparant about all the bots on our servers, this channel is used to provide context and details on each one and how they are deployed through the server.

All bots have the <@&752094094372634634> role and have full access to the "Server Admin" category of the server.

Groovy as a bot that plays music in VC channels.  It only has access to <#763178904595988520> and <#763178861491519498>.  Access to other channels is being evaluated.  If this would be of value to you, please be sure to suggest it in <#754995041117798480>.

The bot has been server-deafened, meaning that it cannot hear anything in VC channels.
